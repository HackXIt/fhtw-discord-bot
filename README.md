A custom made discord bot specifically for managing my student servers @fhtw

# Introduction

I am a student and I have been managing a few student community servers at the FHTW for quite a while now.
Mainly I manage those servers out of my own free will and this bot is a hobby of mine.

Managing a student server on a manual basis is quite tedious, and I always wanted to setup a bot which can:
 - Automate the on-boarding process
 - Assign roles to users based on their study program (i.e. group A or B)
 - Store their student mail address for verification purpose (i.e. to prevent spam and keep membership exclusive to students)
 - Provide easy-to-use and quality-of-life functionalities for the students on the server (i.e. send mails to a group of students, setup a custom group, pin messages, spread faculty news via mail redirection, etc.)
 - Be helpful for student interaction and engagement (i.e. activity tracking, student-of-the-month, reward system, etc.)

This bot is a work in progress and I hope to release it before winter semester 2024.

I am also open to suggestions and feedback, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any ideas or suggestions.
